            <h3>Academic Achievements</h3>
            <p><strong>Class XII:</strong> 91.8% in CBSE examinations from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Faridabad (2022)</p>
            <p><strong>Class X:</strong> 92.4% in CBSE examinations from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Faridabad (2020)</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Navodaya Years: Foundation of My Journey</h2>
        <p>My educational journey began in earnest when I joined Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in Faridabad. JNV schools are known for providing quality education to talented students from rural areas, selected through a rigorous entrance examination. Being accepted into this residential school system was my first significant achievement and the beginning of a transformative chapter in my life.</p>
        
        <p>Life at JNV was structured yet nurturing. The residential nature of the school taught me independence at an early age, while the diverse student body – composed of children from various socioeconomic backgrounds across the district – broadened my worldview and fostered empathy. Looking back, I realize these experiences laid the foundation for my later interest in psychology and human behavior.</p>
        
        <p>The holistic educational approach at JNV meant that alongside academics, we were encouraged to participate in various extracurricular activities. It was here that I first discovered my passion for performance arts, participating in school plays and cultural programs that would later evolve into a deeper interest in theater and media.</p>
        
        <div class="memory">
            <p>"I remember my first stage performance in Class VII – a short skit about environmental conservation. Despite initial stage fright, the experience of connecting with an audience was exhilarating. That moment sparked something in me that continues to influence my interest in theater and performance arts today."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>National Cadet Corps (NCC): Discipline and Leadership</h2>
        <p>One of the most formative experiences of my pre-college years was joining the National Cadet Corps (NCC) in 2020. The NCC is a youth development movement in India that provides military training to students, emphasizing discipline, leadership, and service to the nation. My time as an NCC cadet instilled in me values that continue to guide my approach to challenges and responsibilities.</p>
        
        <p>The rigorous physical training, including daily exercises, drills, and occasional camps, pushed me beyond my comfort zone and taught me the importance of physical fitness and mental resilience. The early morning parades, uniform inspections, and team exercises built a sense of discipline that has proven invaluable throughout my academic journey.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond physical training, the NCC emphasized leadership development through various activities and roles. Whether leading a squad during a parade or organizing community service initiatives, I learned how to motivate peers, delegate responsibilities, and maintain composure under pressure. These experiences later influenced my approach to leadership roles at Ashoka University, particularly in my work as a Campus Buddy and Student Advisor.</p>
        
        <p>Perhaps most importantly, the NCC instilled a sense of social responsibility and community service. Participating in blood donation camps, tree plantation drives, and disaster management training broadened my understanding of citizenship and reinforced my commitment to making a positive impact on society.</p>
        
        <h2>Academic Journey and Growth</h2>
        <p>My academic performance at JNV reflected both consistency and growth. Scoring 92.4% in my Class X CBSE examinations in 2020 was a proud moment, validating the countless hours spent studying and preparing. This achievement came during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which presented unique challenges for students worldwide.</p>
        
        <p>The pandemic dramatically altered the educational landscape during my senior years of schooling. As classes moved online and traditional learning methods were disrupted, I had to develop greater self-discipline and adaptability. Navigating these unprecedented circumstances taught me resilience and the importance of finding solutions in challenging situations – skills that would prove valuable in my university transition.</p>
        
        <p>Despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic, I maintained my academic focus and secured 91.8% in my Class XII CBSE examinations in 2022. This achievement reflected not just academic knowledge but also the ability to persevere during uncertain times – a quality that has continued to serve me well at Ashoka University.</p>

        <h2>Beyond Academics: Early Passions and Interests</h2>
        <p>While academic achievement was important during my school years, JNV's emphasis on holistic development allowed me to explore various interests that would later evolve into deeper passions. Sports played a significant role in my school life, teaching me teamwork, healthy competition, and the value of physical fitness.</p>
        
        <p>My interest in running began during these formative years, with interschool competitions fueling my competitive spirit. Little did I know that this would later translate into completing multiple marathons, including securing a Top 3 finish in a 10km run-a-thon organized by STEPS NGO during my university years.</p>
        
        <p>Cultural activities were equally important in my development. School cultural festivals and competitions provided platforms to explore creative expression through acting, public speaking, and event organization. These experiences sparked my interest in theater and event management – skills I would later refine at Ashoka University.</p>
        
        <div class="memory">
            <p>"Organizing our school's annual cultural festival in Class XI was my first real experience with event management. Coordinating various performances, managing schedules, and troubleshooting last-minute issues taught me more about leadership and problem-solving than any classroom lesson could."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Transition to University Life</h2>
        <p>The journey from JNV to Ashoka University represented not just an academic transition but a significant cultural shift. Moving from a structured residential school environment to the liberal, diverse atmosphere of a university campus required adjustment and growth.</p>
        
        <p>The application process itself was an educational journey. Researching universities, understanding different programs, and preparing application materials helped me clarify my academic interests and career aspirations. My decision to pursue psychology at Ashoka University was influenced by both personal interest in human behavior and the university's reputation for interdisciplinary education.</p>
        
        <p>Receiving my acceptance letter from Ashoka was a moment of immense pride and excitement. It represented not just personal achievement but
