            <h2>Theatre & Acting</h2>

            
            <p>My journey into the world of theatre began almost by accident. During my first semester at Ashoka University, I wandered into an audition for a student production out of sheer curiosity. Little did I know that this casual decision would spark a passion that would become a significant part of my university experience.</p>
            
            <p>Since then, I've had the privilege of performing as a lead character in three plays with Ashoka's theatre society. Each production has been a unique opportunity to explore different facets of human emotion and experience – from the comedic timing required in a farce to the emotional depth needed for dramatic roles.</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                <p>"Theatre is the most immediate way to understand what it means to be someone else. Each character I portray teaches me something new about empathy and human psychology."</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>My first major role was in a production of "The Importance of Being Earnest," where I played Jack Worthing. The challenge of mastering Oscar Wilde's witty dialogue while maintaining the character's complex motivations taught me the importance of nuance in performance. The hours spent rehearsing, blocking scenes, and developing character relationships showed me how collaborative the art of theatre truly is.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond the stage, I've also explored acting through short films. As an active member of Ashoka's film club, I've had the opportunity to act in two student short films, exploring how screen acting differs from stage performance. The intimacy of film acting – where the smallest facial expressions can convey powerful emotions – has been a fascinating contrast to the broader movements required in theatre.</p>

            <p>My involvement in theatre has complemented my psychology studies in unexpected ways. The process of character analysis – understanding motivations, background, and psychological traits – has deepened my appreciation for human complexity. Similarly, my knowledge of psychological principles has informed my approach to character development, creating a rewarding feedback loop between academic learning and artistic expression.</p>

            <h2>Film & Media Production</h2>

            
            <p>My fascination with visual storytelling led me to an unforgettable opportunity during the summer of 2023, when I joined Climb Media as a Direction Assistant. This three-month internship opened my eyes to the intricate world of professional film production and allowed me to work alongside industry professionals on high-profile projects.</p>
            
            <p>The highlight of this experience was undoubtedly assisting with the direction of a short film featuring renowned Bollywood actor Javed Jaffrey. Being on set with such an established performer was both intimidating and inspiring. I was responsible for coordinating various aspects of the production, from managing shooting schedules to assisting with scene blocking and ensuring continuity between takes.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <p>Working closely with the director, I learned the importance of clear communication and creative problem-solving when unexpected challenges arose during filming. Whether it was adjusting to changing lighting conditions or reworking scenes due to time constraints, I gained valuable insights into the adaptability required in professional filmmaking.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Beyond the film set, my role at Climb Media also involved creating pitch decks and strategic reports for high-profile clients like Hyundai and the Lodha Group. This experience taught me how to translate creative visions into compelling presentations that aligned with client objectives. The market research and data analysis I conducted to tailor these presentations drew on the analytical skills I had developed in my psychology studies.</p>
            
            <p>This immersion in the world of professional media production confirmed my belief in the power of visual storytelling to communicate complex ideas and evoke emotional responses. It also showed me how my background in psychology could inform my understanding of audience engagement and narrative impact.</p>

            <h2>Marathon Running & Physical Endurance</h2>
    
            
            <p>Running has become more than just a physical activity for me – it's a practice that connects body and mind, teaching me lessons about perseverance that extend far beyond the track. My journey with distance running began during my school years but developed into a serious passion during my time at Ashoka University.</p>
            
            <p>I've completed multiple marathons both on and off campus, each one pushing me to discover new depths of determination. One of my proudest achievements was securing a Top 3 finish in a 10km run-a-thon organized by STEPS NGO, an event that combined my passion for running with my commitment to supporting causes that make a difference in the community.</p>
            
            <p>My experience in the HCL Cyclothon in 2024 further tested my endurance capabilities. Finishing in the Top 5 among over 1,300 amateur cyclists in the 27km event, with a time under 48 minutes, was a testament to the physical conditioning and mental resilience I've developed through consistent training.</p>
            
            <p>The discipline required for distance running has positively influenced other areas of my life, including my academic performance and professional commitments. The habit of setting incremental goals, maintaining consistent effort, and pushing through discomfort has proven invaluable in my journey from a 2.6 GPA to achieving a perfect 4.0 and earning a place on the Dean's List.</p>

            <h2>Creative Projects & Achievements</h2>
            
            <p>Beyond my major passions, I've engaged in various creative projects that have allowed me to explore different forms of expression and problem-solving. These experiences have enriched my understanding of communication and persuasion across different mediums.</p>
            
            <div class="project-box">
                <h3>Content Creation Award</h3>
                <p>In 2024, I won Second Prize in the Bombay Shaving Company's Content Creation Competition. This achievement required me to develop innovative, high-engagement content that resonated with the brand's target audience while standing out in a crowded digital landscape. Drawing on my understanding of consumer psychology and visual storytelling, I created content that balanced entertainment value with effective brand messaging.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="project-box">
                <h3>Marketing Strategy Development</h3>
                <p>My interest in the psychology of consumer behavior led me to participate in Ashoka University's Marketing Case Competition in 2024. Working with a team, I developed a comprehensive go-to-market (GTM) strategy for Quintinno Labs, securing a Top 2 ranking among over 100 participants. This project allowed me to apply psychological principles to real-world marketing challenges, identifying audience pain points and crafting messaging that addressed underlying motivations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>These creative endeavors have confirmed my belief in the power of interdisciplinary thinking. By bringing together insights from psychology, visual arts, and marketing, I've been able to develop projects that connect with audiences on multiple levels. Each creative challenge has taught me something new about communication, persuasion, and human engagement.</p>
