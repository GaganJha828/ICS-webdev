            <h3>My Journey So Far</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my personal space on the web! I'm Gagan Jha, a 20-year-old Psychology student at Ashoka University with a passion for understanding human behavior, and exploring creative pursuits. My journey has been shaped by diverse experiences that have helped me grow both academically and personally.</p>
            
            <p>Growing up in Faridabad and studying at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya laid the foundation for my academic interests. Those formative years taught me the value of perseverance and cultivated my curiosity about human potential. When I entered Ashoka University to pursue Psychology, I found myself drawn to both the scientific rigor of data analysis and the nuanced understanding of human behavior that psychology offers.</p>
            
            <p>As I've progressed through my academic journey, I've discovered a deep satisfaction in helping others navigate their own paths. This has manifested in my work as a Student Advisor with the Lodha Genius Program and as a Campus Buddy at Ashoka, where I've had the privilege of mentoring students and supporting those with visual impairments.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond academics, I find joy in creative expression through acting, participating in marathons, and exploring media production. These diverse interests inform my approach to psychology and enrich my understanding of human experience from multiple perspectives.</p>
            
            <p>On this website, you'll find more about my academic journey, projects, and passions. I hope sharing my experiences might inspire others to embrace both analytical thinking and creative exploration in their own lives.</p>

            <h3>Academic Pursuits</h3>
            <p>At Ashoka University, I've been pursuing a B.Sc in Psychology with a current CGPA of 3.43/4. My academic journey hasn't always been smooth â€“ I started with a 2.6 GPA but through dedication and finding my academic rhythm, I've improved to achieve a perfect 4.0 in recent semesters, earning me a place on the Dean's List for three consecutive terms.</p>
            
            <p>My academic interests lie at the intersection of data analysis and human behavior. I've conducted statistical research using methods like ANOVA and T-tests to analyze real-world datasets, developing proficiency in tools like Jamovi and Excel to visualize trends and derive actionable insights. These projects have strengthened my analytical thinking while keeping human factors at the center of my approach.</p>
            
            <p>I'm particularly fascinated by how psychological principles apply to marketing and consumer behavior. This led me to develop projects like a challenger marketing strategy for lab-grown diamonds and comprehensive content strategies for brands like Sleepy Owl. Understanding the psychological drivers behind consumer decisions has become a passionate area of study for me.</p>

            <h3>Professional Development</h3>
            <p>My professional experiences have been shaped by internships and leadership roles that allow me to apply psychological concepts in real-world settings. As a Teaching Assistant in the Lodha Genius Program, I supported a class of over 30 students, leading group discussions and offering personalized guidance that enhanced their problem-solving abilities.</p>
            
            <p>My work as a Direction Assistant at Climb Media gave me valuable insights into the creative industry, where I created pitch decks for high-profile clients like Hyundai and Lodha Group while also getting hands-on experience in film production, including working on a project featuring Bollywood actor Javed Jaffrey.</p>
            
            <p>These professional experiences have taught me how to bridge theory and practice, whether I'm analyzing property markets for sales strategies or developing brand identities for emerging products. Each opportunity has reinforced my belief in the power of combining analytical thinking with creative approaches.</p>
